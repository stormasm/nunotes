### Motivation

Over the past couple of weeks the core team meetings have been highlighted
by three important topics that we have not discussed in quite a while so
we decided to reach out to some key developers to get their thoughts and
opinions on how to move forward.

### New-nu-parser (NNP)

In reality we think in order to get the NNP developed and integrated into Nushell
we are going to need the help of a few key developers who have the "ability"
and "knowledge" to guide us to a soft landing and integration.  The thesis being
that with out these people we do not currently have the expertise to complete
the job.  And if this is the case then we can take the NNP off the table and
move forward with plans to complete 1.0.
