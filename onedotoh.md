# Should the new-nu-parser be part of 1.0 ?

### Motivation

Over the past couple of weeks the core team meetings have been highlighted
by three important topics that we have not discussed in quite a while so
we decided to reach out to some key developers to get their thoughts and
opinions on how to move forward.

The Concepts :

- New-nu-parser
- One Dot Oh
- Funding

The People :

- Sophia
- Andres ?
- Devyn
- Jakub
- Sholderbach ?

### New-nu-parser (NNP)

In reality we think in order to get the NNP developed and integrated into Nushell
we are going to need the help of a few key developers who have the "ability"
and "knowledge" to guide us to a soft landing and integration.  The thesis being
that with out a subset of these people we do not currently have the expertise to complete
the job.  And if this is the case then we can take the NNP off the table and
move forward with plans to complete 1.0.

This was confirmed recently in communication with Wind and Yash who both
expressed on discord (in so many words) that they do not have the knowledge
needed to complete the task without the help of the "core NNP" developers.

Based on developers who have contributed to the new-nu-parser over time.

### One Dot Oh

One of the main reasons we have not gotten to Nushell 1.0 yet is because for the
past year or more we have believed and held fast that it was critical and essential
to have the new-nu-parser be part of Nushell 1.0

As time passes and reality sets in this idea and dream (so to speak) is starting
to be questioned.  There are many reasons for this but in the end we are not
going to have the NNP inside 1.0 unless we have the help and architectural guidance
of the core people listed above.

### Funding

Which brings us to our third key idea of funding.  If the above named developers
are wiling to help on this effort would funding help motivate them to be more
involved and spend the time that it takes to complete the task.

If we were able to get the help of the above named developers then a funding
effort could begin in the next number of months after some research is done to determine
the best way to do this.

#### Sophia and Devyn

Our belief is that we could get the funding required to get the job done if
Sophia and Devyn were involved.  At least we would make a whole hearted effort
to attempt to get the funding required by the end of summer 2026 and hopefully
sooner.
